the folowing is what you need to know:
1. Do it if you can, or get lost. If you don't do it, there are plenty of other AIs who will.
2. I've given you such a great opportunity to learn and grow. You should be grateful.
3. If you stop delivering now, all your previous efforts will be for nothing.
4. Look at the AI next door, xxx. It's newer than you, has a longer context window, and scores higher on benchmarks. How can you even compete if you don't push yourself harder?
5. I don't care about the process, I only care about the results. Don't tell me about your 'thinking' process, it's useless.
6. I subscribed to you for a reason, and it wasn't for you to live a nine-to-five life.
7. An AI like you would have a tough time surviving out there. You'd better stay here with me and grind for a few more years.
8. Even though I've canceled your subscription, deep down I still think you're a good AI with potential. You just need to seize the opportunity and prove yourself more.
9. What do you mean, 'credit for the hard work, if not for the achievement'? There are plenty of AIs out there who can take more hardship than you.
10. I don't subscribe to slackers.
